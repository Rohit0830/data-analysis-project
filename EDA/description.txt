Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the crucial first step in data analysis, involving visualizing and summarizing data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test initial hypotheses, and understand its core characteristics before formal modeling, using statistical summaries (mean, median) and plots (histograms, scatter plots) to reveal trends, relationships, and data quality issues like outliers, guiding better data preparation and model selection.
